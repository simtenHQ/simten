docs(readme): correct quickstart example to match shipped `SimulationHandle` API

The original quickstart used `using sim = simulate(...)`, `sim.setInput(...)`, and `sim.getOutput(...)` — none of which exist on the shipped type. The actual API is `const sim = simulate(...)`, `sim.set({ a: 1 })`, and `sim.get('sum')`. Updated the example to match the real API and noted that `using` is not currently supported (the handle exposes a plain `dispose()` method).
