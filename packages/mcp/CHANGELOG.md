- cc6b76e: docs(readme): use `claude mcp add` for setup, document the hardcoded WS port

  Replaced the incorrect setup snippet that told users to paste JSON into `~/.claude/settings.json` (which Claude Code ignores for MCP registration). The right entry point is the `claude mcp add` CLI, which writes to the correct config file automatically. Also added a brief note about the WebSocket bridge port (`127.0.0.1:19847`) being hardcoded — running two MCP instances simultaneously fails the second on `EADDRINUSE`. A configurable port + retry-on-bind is tracked as a follow-up.

### Patch Changes

- fix(show_circuit): drop server-side execution pre-flight, always await render-ack including fresh-open connect (#139)

  `show_circuit` previously ran a server-side execution pre-flight that rejected circuits using npm imports (because the MCP process can't resolve `esm.sh`). Removed the pre-flight; the tool now always awaits the browser's render acknowledgement, which is the real source of truth for whether a circuit rendered. Fresh-open connections (no tab yet → browser launches → first render) now go through the same await path as warm reconnects.
